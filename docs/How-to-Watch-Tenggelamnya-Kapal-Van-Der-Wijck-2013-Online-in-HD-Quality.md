## What is Tenggelamnya Kapal Van Der Wijck (2013) Based on?
  
Tenggelamnya Kapal Van Der Wijck (2013) is based on a novel of the same name by Hamka, a prominent Indonesian Islamic scholar and author. The novel was first published in 1938 as a serial in the magazine Pedoman Masjarakat, and later as a book in 1939. The novel is considered one of Hamka's best works and one of the classics of Indonesian literature.
  
The novel is set in the early 20th century and explores the issues of love, culture, and identity in Minangkabau society. The novel criticizes the rigid and discriminatory traditions of Minangkabau, especially the matrilineal system that favors pure-blooded nobles over mixed-race commoners. The novel also portrays the role of women in Minangkabau as submissive and dependent on men.
  
## What are the Main Themes of Tenggelamnya Kapal Van Der Wijck (2013)?
  
Tenggelamnya Kapal Van Der Wijck (2013) has several themes that reflect Hamka's views and values as an Islamic thinker and writer. Some of the main themes are:

- Love vs. Tradition: The novel shows how love can be hindered by tradition, especially when it comes to social status and background. Zainuddin and Hayati's love is doomed from the start because of their different origins and positions in Minangkabau society. They are forced to choose between their love and their family's honor.
- Fate vs. Free Will: The novel also shows how fate can be cruel and unpredictable, and how human beings have limited control over their destiny. Zainuddin and Hayati's fate is sealed by the sinking of the van der Wijck ship, which symbolizes their tragic end. They are unable to escape their fate despite their efforts and sacrifices.
- Islam vs. Adat: The novel also shows how Islam can be a source of guidance and inspiration for human beings, and how adat (customs) can be a source of oppression and injustice. Hamka, as an Islamic scholar, advocates for a more progressive and egalitarian interpretation of Islam that respects human dignity and rights. He also criticizes the adat of Minangkabau that discriminates against mixed-race people and women.
